# Coding Challenge - 009: Caesar Cipher

The purpose of this coding challenge is to write a program in bash scrit that  an encrypted text with `cease cipher` technique.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this coding chacllenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify, and apply programming knowledge for an appropriate solution.

- Implement conditional statements effectively to solve a problem.

- Implement loops to solve a problem.

- Execute operations on strings.

- Decompose the problem into subproblems and solve them distinctly using functions.

- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by solving the problem effectively.

## Problem Statement

In cryptography, a `Caesar cipher` is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.


- Expected Output:

The expected terminal output is as follows but of course, you should also have created the plainext.txt containing the correct decrypted message.

```text
Encryption suceeded. Plaintext is in plaintext.txt
```
